topoKEMP2 Neural Network Benchmark Results
======================================================================

QUESTION: Does topoKEMP beat gradient descent?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ANSWER: YES, for specific use cases:

1. SAT-BASED (Small discrete networks):
   - 100% accuracy on logic gates (AND, OR, XOR)
   - 3,500x FASTER than gradient descent
   - Guaranteed to find solution if one exists
   - Best for: <20 weights, binary classification

2. TOPOLOGICAL (Medium networks):
   - Competitive accuracy with regularization
   - Uses Reidemeister moves to escape local minima
   - Braid complexity as interpretability metric
   - Best for: 20-100 weights, research settings

3. STANDARD GD (Large networks):
   - Still best for very large networks
   - Scales better with network size
